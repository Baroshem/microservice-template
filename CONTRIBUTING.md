# Contributing to @otasoft/microservice-template

We would love for you to contribute to @otasoft/microservice-template and help make it even better than it is
today! As a contributor, here are the guidelines we would like you to follow:

- [Issues and Bugs](#issue)
- [Feature Requests](#feature)
- [Coding Rules](#rules)

## <a name="issue"></a> Found a Bug?

If you find a bug in the source code, you can help us by submitting an issue. Even better, you can submit a Pull Request with a fix.

## <a name="feature"></a> Missing a Feature?

You can request a new feature by submitting an issue to our GitHub
Repository. If you would like to implement a new feature, please submit an issue with
a proposal for your work first, to be sure that we can use it.
Please consider what kind of change it is:

- For a **Major Feature**, first open an issue and outline your proposal so that it can be
  discussed. This will also allow us to better coordinate our efforts, prevent duplication of work,
  and help you to craft the change so that it is successfully accepted into the project.
- **Small Features** can be crafted and directly submitted as a Pull Request.

## <a name="rules"></a> Coding Rules
### Commit Message Format
```
doc: update change readme file

```

### Type

Must be one of the following:

- **build**: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies (example scopes: gulp, broccoli, npm)
- **ci**: Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts (example scopes: Travis, Circle, BrowserStack, SauceLabs)
- **doc**: Documentation only changes
- **feat**: A new feature
- **fix**: A bug fix
- **refactor**: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- **style**: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)

The subject contains succinct description of the change:

- use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes"
- don't capitalize first letter
